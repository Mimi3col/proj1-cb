## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

When I started building the webpage, I wanted to make the process a lot more complected then it needed to be. I wanted to find a way to accomplish the cards like I did with the Pre-Work, but found that that was very time consuming. Instead I used the Table format like in the lab and created components for cards that where placed in different areas of the table to show the 4 by 3 layout on the web page.
